# Fill-The-Garden
Filling a rectangle with maximum amount of shapes

### **Problem:** 
We have a **garden** in rectangular shape and we want to plant some trees in it, so that the **overall area** of their crowns is as high as possible. The crowns can have the shape of:  
* Regular triangle  
* Regular Hexagon  
* Ellipse
* Circle  

The task is to write a program which takes:
* The width and height of the garden  
* Angle of rotation (the origin of the coordinate system is the bottom left of the rectangle)  
* The type of the trees to plant  
* Dimensions of a tree:  
  * Triangle/Hexagon: length of a side  
  * Ellipse: length of both axis  
  * Circle: length of the radius  
  
Then plants as many trees of that type as possible, rotates the garden and outputs:
* Number of trees in the garden  
* Coordinates of the centers of the planted trees
* Overall area covered with plants (%)

**Note: You can copy the coordinates of the centers in https://www.desmos.com/calculator to visualize them better.**
